I have officially moved my blog! Previously, I was using Ghost for posting some tutorials, changed my Ghost themes before finally settling down on the Uno-Zen theme (which is wonderful). However, in the end I decided using Buster to deploy posts is simply too troublesome and buggy. My current blog is powered by Jekyll, which is native to GitHub so this seems to be a natural choice given I'm hosting this blog on GitHub!

One thing Jekyll lacks is a good CMS, but I have found an appropriate substitute prose.io, which allows you to write in Markdown and integrates very well with GitHub. You should certainly consider prose.io if you're trying to create a Jekyll blog!

Anyway, in the days to come I will be sharing more about my adventures in learning Machine Learning, and of course, arrange more fingerstyle guitar covers!

Till then, `print 'goodbye world!`

```
def goodbye():
    print 'goodbye!'


```
